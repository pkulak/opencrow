# Configuration

## Backend selection

Set `OPENCROW_BACKEND` to choose the messaging backend. Defaults to `matrix`.

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| `matrix` | Matrix rooms via mautrix (default, backwards compatible) |
| `nostr` | Nostr NIP-17 encrypted DMs |
| `signal` | Signal chats via signal-cli |

## Bot commands

Send these as plain text messages in any conversation with the bot:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `!help` | Show available commands |
| `!restart` | Kill the current pi process and start fresh on the next message |
| `!stop` | Abort the currently running agent turn |
| `!compact` | Compact conversation context to reduce token usage |
| `!skills` | List the skills loaded for this bot instance |
| `!verify` | (Matrix only) Set up cross-signing so the bot's device shows as verified |

## General configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENCROW_BACKEND` | `matrix` | Messaging backend (`matrix`, `nostr`, or `signal`) |
| `OPENCROW_PI_BINARY` | `pi` | Path to the pi binary |
| `OPENCROW_PI_SESSION_DIR` | `/var/lib/opencrow/sessions` | Session data directory |
| `OPENCROW_PI_PROVIDER` | `anthropic` | LLM provider |
| `OPENCROW_PI_MODEL` | `claude-opus-4-6` | Model name |
| `OPENCROW_PI_WORKING_DIR` | `/var/lib/opencrow` | Working directory for pi |
| `OPENCROW_PI_IDLE_TIMEOUT` | `30m` | Kill pi after this duration of inactivity |
| `OPENCROW_PI_SYSTEM_PROMPT` | built-in | Custom system prompt |
| `OPENCROW_SOUL_FILE` | _(empty)_ | Path to a file containing the system prompt (overrides `OPENCROW_PI_SYSTEM_PROMPT`) |
| `OPENCROW_PI_SKILLS` | _(empty)_ | Comma-separated skill directory paths |
| `OPENCROW_PI_SKILLS_DIR` | _(empty)_ | Directory containing skill subdirectories |
| `OPENCROW_SHOW_TOOL_CALLS` | `false` | Show tool invocations (bash, read, edit, …) as messages in the chat |

## File handling

**Receiving files** — Users can send images, audio, video, and documents to the
bot. Attachments are downloaded to the session directory under `attachments/`
and the file path is passed to pi so it can read or process the file with its
tools. On Nostr, media URLs in DMs are automatically detected and downloaded.

**Sending files back** — Pi can send files to the user by including
`<sendfile>/absolute/path</sendfile>` tags in its response. The bot strips the
tags, uploads/sends each referenced file (to Matrix via MXC, to a Blossom
server for Nostr, or directly via signal-cli for Signal), and delivers them as
attachments. Multiple `<sendfile>` tags can appear in a single response.

| `OPENCROW_NOSTR_ALLOWED_USERS` | No | Comma-separated npubs or hex pubkeys |

*Either `OPENCROW_NOSTR_PRIVATE_KEY` or `OPENCROW_NOSTR_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE` is required.

## Signal configuration

OpenCrow uses [`signal-cli`](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli) in **daemon mode** and talks to it over the
JSON-RPC socket interface.
You must register or link your Signal account with signal-cli before running OpenCrow.

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENCROW_SIGNAL_ACCOUNT` | Yes | Bot Signal account identifier (`+E164`, UUID, or username as supported by signal-cli) |
| `OPENCROW_SIGNAL_CLI_BINARY` | No | Path to `signal-cli` binary (default: `signal-cli`) |
| `OPENCROW_SIGNAL_CONFIG_DIR` | No | signal-cli config/data directory (default: `/var/lib/opencrow/signal-cli`) |
| `OPENCROW_SIGNAL_SOCKET_PATH` | No | Unix socket path for signal-cli daemon JSON-RPC (default: `/var/lib/opencrow/signal-cli/opencrow-jsonrpc.sock`) |
| `OPENCROW_ALLOWED_USERS` | No | Additional comma-separated sender IDs allowlist filter |

### Signal account setup

The NixOS module installs an `opencrow-signal-cli` wrapper on the host that
runs signal-cli inside the container with the correct config directory. Use it
to register or link an account before starting the service.

**Option A: Register a new number**

```bash
sudo opencrow-signal-cli -a +12025550123 register
sudo opencrow-signal-cli -a +12025550123 verify CODE
```

**Option B: Link to an existing Signal account**

```bash
sudo opencrow-signal-cli -a +12025550123 startLink
# Scan the QR code / URI with your primary Signal device
sudo opencrow-signal-cli -a +12025550123 finishLink
```

Once linked, set `OPENCROW_SIGNAL_ACCOUNT = "+12025550123"` and start the
service. The account data persists in `OPENCROW_SIGNAL_CONFIG_DIR`.

## Secrets and authentication

### Nostr private key

Pass secret files into the container using the `credentialFiles` option. Files
are loaded via systemd-nspawn's `--load-credential` on the host and imported by
the inner service via `ImportCredential`. They are available to opencrow under
`$CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY/<name>`.

```nix
services.opencrow = {
  credentialFiles = {
    "nostr-private-key" = /path/to/nostr-private-key;
  };
  environment.OPENCROW_NOSTR_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE = "%d/nostr-private-key";
};
```

`%d` is the systemd specifier for `$CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY` and works in
`Environment=` directives.

### LLM provider credentials

Pi needs credentials for your LLM provider. There are two ways to set this up:

**Option A: API key** — set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (or the equivalent for your
provider) in an environment file and pass it via the `environmentFiles` option.
API keys don't expire and are the simplest approach.

**Option B: OAuth (Claude Pro/Max)** — pi supports OAuth against your Anthropic
account, so you can use your subscription instead of API credits. The NixOS
module installs an `opencrow-pi` wrapper on the host that runs pi inside the
container with the correct environment. To authenticate:

```bash
sudo opencrow-pi auth login
```

Pi will print a URL — open it in any browser, complete the Anthropic login, and
paste the redirect URL back into the terminal. No local browser is required on
the server itself. The refresh token persists across restarts — you only need to
do this once (unless the token gets revoked).

### Environment files

For secrets that are plain key=value pairs (e.g. API keys, access tokens), use
`environmentFiles`. These are bind-mounted read-only into the container and
loaded by systemd's `EnvironmentFile=` directive before the service starts:

```nix
services.opencrow.environmentFiles = [
  /run/secrets/opencrow-env  # contains ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-...
];
```
